# RandomActs5
ASP.NET 5 version of Random Acts project.

This project is a demonstration project created using Beta 8 of ASP.NET 5, MVC 6, and Entity Framework 7. 
it was developed by creating a new ASP.NET 5 project in Visual Studio 2015 and migrating pieces of the original 
plitwin/RandomActs project (developed with ASP.NET 4.5, MVC 5, and Entity Framework 6) into it.

This project creates a fictious web site, Random Acts of Kindness, that can be used to create Acts (events), 
Actors (volunteers), and match actors to acts. 

The data is stored in a SQL Server database of three tables, RandomActs, RandomActors, and RandomActActors.
